				<p class="question">
					How are your card games made?
				</p>

				<p class="answer"> 
					The whole process is done by our team. We start by digitally drawing the card. Then, we can print it. We cut, laminate, then cut again. We check that the good amount of cards is in each pack before declaring the product to be done.
				</p>
			</div>
			</br>

			<div class="question-block">
				<p class="question">
					How do I know how to play your card games?
				</p>

				<p class="answer"> 
					An instruction card is included in each pack of cards. Unfortunately, that card is only in French. If you want a translation for the rules, please contact us directly.

			<div class="question-block">

			<div class="question-block">
				<p class="question">
					How can I buy a pack of cards?
				</p>

				<p class="answer"> 
					To buy a pack, you will have to contact us so we can arrange a meeting in Montreal. Indeed, JA regulations force us to exchange money and product at the same time. For this reason, we are also not allowed to send packs by mail or accept online purchases.

			<div class="question-block">
				<p class="question">

					You can support us by talking about Ludicartes to your acquaintances and by following us on social media. Of course, you can also buy our card games, but even merely opening this website help us grow.
