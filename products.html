				 		<h1> <i>Rupture</i></h1>
				 		<br/><br/>

				 		&emsp;Free your imagination in this game to be played with friends and family.

				 		</br></br>
				 		&emsp;Each player draws a card on their turn. They then need to interpret the drawing on the card to tell a story, by associating the card to a word in their head. Watch out! They need to stay subtle to avoid alerting the other players. If another player suspects that the narrator, who started the story, has said their word, then they should scream "Rupture!". If they were correct, then they take the card. If they were wrong, then the narrator takes a card and continues their story. If they manage to finsh it without anyone finding their word, then they keeps their card. It is then the next player's turn, but they have to continue the story of the person before them. The game continues until there are no cards left in the deck and the winner is the one with the most cards.
				 		<br/><br/>
				 		&emsp;There are a total of 53 drawing cards in the game, of which a part is seen to the left.

				 		<br/><br/>

				 		&emsp;A simple and fun game based on additions until 10.

				 		</br></br>
				 		&emsp;You start with 5 cards. One at a time, the players have to put in front of them piles of cards that sum up to 10. Each pile can be as big as it needs to be. At the beginning of each turn, the player must draw a card. Their turn ends after each pile they complete.
	</br>&emsp;The goal of the game is to have the most piles. The game ends when the draw pile is empty and nobody can play.
</br>
	</br>&emsp;The special cards, which are <i>+2</i>, <i>prohibited</i>, <i>x</i> and <i>exchange</i>, add diversity to the game, for a total of 54 playing cards. </div>
